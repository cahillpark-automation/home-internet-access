# Home Internet Access

## Apartment via Fibre providers

**Generic direction specifically around modern Network-enabled Apartments**

The case study (presentation) is from my apartment in San Jose - Modera at The Alameda

As one typically finds in modern apartment units, there are various outlets with Ethernet (and Cable) access lines
leading back to a "customer" access panel (typically in the bedroom closet).  One can expect at least one in every
bedroom, the living room and/or the dining area.

A single Ethernet wire (CAT6) per location and one Cable wire for each bedroom and the living room.

At a minimum, the providers offer 1 Gigabit speeds, but can go up to 10 Gigabit [advertised].

The easiest for non-Cable internet only (requiring no additional equipment) is one Ethernet wire between the access panel and one location
(likely the livingroom) with all of the other connections left untouched.  A Wifi signal from the "provided equipment" is then
available for use by the Phones, Tablets and Computers.  For the Smart TV or Streaming box, it might be configured to use Wifi
or an Ethernet wire from the "provided equipment".

Cable Providers tend to use the Cable outlet to provide Internet and Channel broadcasting to the TV set.  Typically, the Ethernet wire
is unused, for the easy / no cost solution.  The Cable goes into the TV as well as "provided equipment" which takes care of the Wifi
Signal.

The presentation then explores next steps to upgrading and leveraging the Ethernet wires, which might enable work from home fast
network bandwidth, on-line gaming requirements and added security / Wifi distribution scenarios.

**Documentation and Guidance around High Speed Internet in Cahill Park TownHomes**

The presentation materials were inspired by the option to use Sail Internet as an alternative to the existing provider.

Provided as an orientation to Cahill Park HOA members regarding the adoption of Sail Internet in place
of the Cable Provider.  Included are details of the challenges around the physical CAT6 provided by
the original construction, especially in the initial phase units.

At the time of the presentation (2018), I was the President of the Association and Board Member represenative
of the Special Project Committee.
